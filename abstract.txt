Plots and diagrams are a common visual means of conveying information in scientific talks, papers, and theses. A good plot or diagram conveys the desired information clearly and in a way that gives understanding that would be lacking in a table or description giving the same information by itself. In addition, the plot or diagram should be understandable to people with various types of colorblindness, when printed on a printer (color or greyscale), or shown on a projector. A bad plot or diagram can serve as a distraction and cause confusion, or be otherwise difficult to read. This presentation will show how to make plots and diagrams more clear and readable. In addition, computer and printing considerations will be discussed. These include screens and projectors, printers, image formats, fonts, and available software for plotting, making diagrams, and making presentations.
